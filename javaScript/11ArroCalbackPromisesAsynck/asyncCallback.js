Asynchronous Example
Callbacks are especially useful for handling asynchronous operations. Here's an example using setTimeout: */

// A function that simulates a delay and then calls a callback
function fetchData(callback) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('Data fetched!');
        callback('Fetched Data');
    }, 2000); // Simulate a 2-second delay
}

// A callback function to process the fetched data
function processData(data) {
    console.log('Processing: ' + data);
}

// Calling the fetchData function with the callback
fetchData(processData);

/*Explanation:
fetchData Function:

Takes a callback function as a parameter.

Uses setTimeout to simulate a delay and prints "Data fetched!" after 2 seconds.

Calls the callback with 'Fetched Data' as an argument.

processData Function:

A function that processes the fetched data and prints a message.

Function Call:

fetchData(processData); calls fetchData with processData as the callback.

This results in "Data fetched!" followed by "Processing: Fetched Data" after 2 seconds.

Benefits of Callbacks
Asynchronous Programming: Callbacks allow you to handle operations that take time without blocking the execution of other code.

Modularity: They help in creating modular and reusable code by separating the main logic from the specific actions that need to be performed.

Event Handling: Commonly used in event-driven programming, where specific actions are performed in response to events like user clicks or data loading. */
